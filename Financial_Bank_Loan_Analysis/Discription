I created a comprehensive Power BI report for financial bank loan analysis, which is structured across three key pages: 
a Summary, an Overview, and a Detailed Page. The report is designed to offer both high-level and granular insights into loan performance and trends.
The Summary Page provides a snapshot of critical metrics through the use of cards that highlight key figures, such as total loans, loan amounts, 
approval rates, and default rates. This page allows decision-makers to quickly gauge the overall performance at a glance.
The Overview Page offers visual representations of loan data, utilizing bar charts and donut charts to display loan distributions, 
approval rates, and category breakdowns. These visuals help in understanding the composition of loans across different segments, such as loan types, customer demographics, or regions.
The Detailed Page allows for in-depth analysis, featuring interactive tables and slicers that enable users to filter and drill down into specific data points. 
Stakeholders can explore loan performance metrics over time or compare different categories of loans to identify trends, outliers, and areas for improvement.
Additionally, the report integrates page navigation features, enabling users to seamlessly switch between pages for a smooth analytical experience. 
The use of slicers enhances interactivity, allowing users to customize views and focus on specific time frames, regions, or customer segments.
